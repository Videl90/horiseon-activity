First I analized the HTML in Chrome. And tested all the links. I notticed, 
that the first button didn't worked.

Then I opened my html file in VS CODE and review the sedimentation. 

Then I reviewed the CSS file and organized it so it would be easier to match
the HTML elements, with their styles. I just moved a the order. 

Then I studied the HTML5 tags seen in class, and some others in google,
so I could chance some divs for this new tags and have more order 
and be easier to identify.

Finally I tried to push my files into my repo, but for some reason I can't
do that.
